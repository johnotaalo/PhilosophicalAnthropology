				<h3>Human Love and Sexuality</h3>

							<div id="modalities">
							<br>
							<h4>
								The two modalities of the human person
							</h4>
								<p>As human beings we need to discover who we are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>To know our personal identity.</li>
									<li>What is our core; what really lies within our hearts.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Facts of life is that as humans we received the gift of life as we are born. In this life there is the physical level(animal level) and personal level.</p>
								<p>At the physical level there is:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Male</li>
									<li>Female</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Male and female refers to the sex which refers to the biological differences; chromosomes, hormonal profiles, internal and external sex organs.</p>
								<p>At the personal level there is the:-</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Masculine</li>
									<li>Feminine</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Masculine and feminine refers to the gender which describes the characteristics that a society or culture delineates as masculine or feminine.</p>

							<h4>
								Elements of our masculine/feminine identity
							</h4>
								<p><strong>Relational: </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Diversity: </strong> is a concept that encompases acceptance and respect. It means understanding that each individual is unique. It is about understanding each other and moving beyond simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity contained within each individual<a href="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~asuomca/diversityinit/definition.html" target="blank">(gladstone, 2014)</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Creativity: </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Complementarity: </strong> We need each other to be fully humna as men and women</p>

							<div id="attraction">

							<h4>
									Power of attraction
							</h4>
								<h5>Nature of masculine/ feminine attraction</h5>
								<p>The female and mala attraction to each other is absolutely physical since this kind of attraction is at the animal level</p>
								<p>Physical attraction in men focuses only on the physical characteristics of women. It is blind to the character and spiritual qualities that make up feminity and it is a sign of humanly underdeveloped man!</p>
								<p>Physical attraction in women only wnats to draw men's attention to her female body. There is absolutely no interest in(does not understand) the nature, challenge and power of the feminine soul. This is a sign of a humanly underdeveloped woman!</p>
								<h4>Understanding the power of attraction</h4>
								<p>The power of the <u>female</u> generates physical desire in the male: once satisfied he withdraws into that satisfaction, into himself, until the desire is aroused again. The power of the <u>feminine</u> generates respect that can grow, even to a form of veneration, which draws a man out of himself and inspires him to higher things<a href="www.cormacburke.or.ke" target="blank">(C. Burke)</a></p>

								<p>For a person`s personal growth, one needs to be aware of their own sexual identity, male or female. Not only to know it but also to accept it. After acceptance then integrate it into their own personality. He/she should then be aware of the sexual identity of the other half of the human race(male/female). They should know it then accept and appreciate it and learn from it. This is because neither man nor woman alone offers a full, perfect model of humanity. Each is a partial model of human being, we need the other half to give the full picture about what it means to be truly human, to create a truly human society!</p>
								<p>The <strong>Challenge</strong> comes:-
									<ul> 
										<li>in knowing and discover each other in our originalty and respect our legitimate differnces</li>
										<li>Accepting and appreciate them; maintain a sense of mutual help and the complementary roles of men and women</li>
										<li>Difference of gender gives rise to particular ways of relating to each other ina variety of situations. Learn how to draw the best from each other in each type of relationship!</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Todiscover the meaning of human sexaulity:-
									<ul>
										<li>Requires mutual appreciation between men and women: true human sexaul appreciation.</li>
										<li>Permits a specail communion between `I` and `you`: this is manifested in marriage and conjugal love.</li>
										<li>Permits the formation of a broader communion which is the family.</li>
									</ul>

							<div id="giving">
							<br>
							<h4>
								Giving oneself or lending oneself
							</h4>
								<h4>Who am I</h4>
								<p>A woman in body and soul is capable of loving others spiritually; this is at the level of the mind/ will/ heart and physically; this is by doing things that do not benefit oneself but others. Woman who is capable of giving herself totally to a man in body and soul.</p>
								<p>A man in body and soul is capable of loving others spiritually; this is at the level of the mind/ will/ heart. Physically he can give himself by doing things for the benefit of other people and not himself. A man who is capable of giving himself totally to a woman in body and soul.</p>
								<h4>Greatest Manifestation of Total Self-giving in body and soul</h4>
								<p>The greatest manifestation of total self-giving is through the conservation of ones sexuality to give to <strong>ONE</strong> person in a special and unique way. Preservation of virginity (secondary virginity if necessary) untul I discover that person.</p>
								<p>This person can be a man or a woman which is determined after marriage: this way sexuality is exercised in conjugal love/act with my spouse. It can also be God Himself, this is through apostolic celibacy: this is manifested by not exercising sexuality by conserving it for God alone.</p>
								<h4>True Giving</h4>
								<p>To be able to really give yourself to another person, you need to posses yourself through self-control; this is of feelings and of sexual impulse e.t.c.</p>
								<p>True, total self-giving, only takes place when you give yourself in body and soul to only one person for your entire life, because you have established a mutual bond whereby you belong to each other for life.</p>
								<h4>How to live through a relationship</h4>
								<p>There are various stages in which relationships develop. In this case focus is on the relationships between people who intend to be together or are together. Each of these stages has its own place/ role in developing the relationship. These stages include:-
									<ul>
										<li>Friendship</li>
										<li>Attraction/love</li>
										<li>Engagement</li>
										<li>Marriage</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Each of these stages has the appropriate words, gestures, among others, with their meanings  or value. At whatever stage the involved parties should not go beyond what is proper to/ appropriate in that stage.</p>
								<p>To give ones`s body without giving oneself/ to give oneself temporarily in premarital sex is not to give, but to only lend. This is because nothing is really ever given unless it is given totally and forever. To `lend` oneself in the sexual use of one`s body is to degrade yourself, your body and your sexuality, this is not using them for what they are meant for.</p>
